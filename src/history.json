I will mention though that I am still a bit upset about you sending a gift to Kurt. Your intentions were very nice to send him a present but I think it was a bit inconsiderate. I'm sure there will be some negative consequences for my life which I don't think you considered. I know his girlfriend is going to be upset and likely start some drama and I don't want either of them involved in my life. I also feel like if there is anyone you would be trying to connect with it would be the person I am currently dating who I am super serious about,  not my ex.",

            "I will follow this policy : I will keep reaching out when I feel like it and will work to not take it too personally when you don’t respond.  I miss you and I think about you every day and wish we got to see each other WAY more often.",
            "The Kurt thing.  It’s not about you and doesn’t involve you.",
            "You don’t own Kurt or me or any kind of friendship we might have.  I was moved to do a kind thing for him and its that simple.  Rather than assume what everyone else is going to read into it and what drama other people might try and squeeze out this simple act I think I would just focus on making sure that you don’t read into it and that you don’t squeeze any drama out of it.",
            "For example - just don’t mention it to Kurt - pretend it didn’t happen.",
